SnowFox demos with Docker
=========================
This repository contains docker files to build images of SnowFox.
These images can be used to try, understand, and play with SnowFox by quickly
creating and destroing environments.

These images are based on `fedora:23` because that is what I run on my laptop.

Images are pushed to the `spogliani/snow-fox` repository on Docker Hub.

Docker images
-------------
The repository builds the following docker images:

  * `latest`: Builds SnowFox out of master.
  * `legacy`: First prototype version of SnowFox (broken!!!).
